Return proper error if a leafref refers to a conditional leaf that does not exist due to the condtition.

RFC-7950 states:
  "If the leaf that the leafref refers to is conditional based on one or
   more features (see Section 7.20.2), then the leaf with the leafref
   type MUST also be conditional based on at least the same set of features."
